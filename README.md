For the Bootstrap part of this assignment I used an example template from the site, but incorporated my own styles/components to most of the pages.

I updated the Navbar to my liking. Removing the active link placeholder, and updating the text.

For the home page I added my own background image, and added my own code into the cover.css file to make it work. i.e.: .bgimage. For the rest of the pages I changed the background color to better match the tone of my home page.

In the portfolio section I used the grid layout to get my images in the center
and added links to each one so that they can be seen in a new tab when clicked.

Lastly, for the contact section I added a form from Bootstrap, and adjusted it to include only the Name, Email, and Message input sections. I had to also add style tags to my portfolio.html, and contact.html files to remove the margin-bottom: auto attribute from my navbar header. This was causing my images and form to be pushed all the way down the page. 

This site is mobile responsive.
